  <h1>Task 3: Iris Flower Classification</h1>
</div>

---

### **Project Goal**
<p>
  The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. This is a classic beginner-friendly classification task.

### **Tools & Dataset**
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib</li>
  <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> The Iris dataset was loaded directly from the Scikit-learn library.</li>
</ul>

---

### **What I Did**
<ol>
  <li>Loaded the built-in Iris dataset.</li>
  <li>Prepared the data by separating features from the target variable.</li>
  <li>Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.</li>
  <li>Trained a <strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</strong> classification model.</li>
  <li>Evaluated the model's performance on the test set.</li>
</ol>

---

### **Final Model Performance**
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The model achieved a perfect accuracy of <strong>1.0 (100%)</strong> on the test data.</li>
  <li>A confusion matrix was generated to visualize the flawless predictions.</li>
</ul>
