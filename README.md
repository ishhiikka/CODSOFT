CodSoft Data Science Internship Projects
Hi there, I'm Ishika Rai ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my project repository!

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology (NIET). I'm passionate about data science and machine learning, and I love turning data into meaningful stories and predictive models.

This repository contains all the projects I completed during my Data Science Internship with CodSoft in July 2025. Each project is organized into its own folder.

Projects Included:
Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

A classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction

A regression model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors.

Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

A classic classification model to identify Iris flower species from their measurements.

Task 4: Sales Prediction

A regression model to forecast product sales based on advertising spend.

Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection

An advanced classification model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

Feel free to explore the folders to see the code and detailed README for each task. Thanks for stopping by!
