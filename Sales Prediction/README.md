  <h1>Task 4: Sales Prediction</h1>
</div>

---

### **Project Goal**
<p>
  This project aims to build a regression model to predict product sales based on advertising expenditure across different media channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper).
</p>

---

### **Tools & Dataset**
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib</li>
  <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> Advertising Sales Dataset from Kaggle.</li>
</ul>

---

### **What I Did**
<ol>
  <li>Loaded the dataset and confirmed it was clean with no missing values.</li>
  <li>Separated the data into features (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and the target (Sales).</li>
  <li>Split the data into training and testing sets.</li>
  <li>Trained a <strong>Linear Regression</strong> model to learn the relationship between advertising spend and sales.</li>
  <li>Evaluated the model using R² score and Mean Squared Error.</li>
</ol>

---

### **Final Model Performance**
<ul>
  <li><strong>R² Score:</strong> The model achieved an excellent R² score of <strong>0.90</strong>, explaining 90% of the variance in sales.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Importance:</strong> A plot was created to show that TV advertising was the most significant predictor of sales.</li>
</ul>
